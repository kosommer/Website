                            We study the effects of market integration on manufacturing emission intensities by using the example of the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. For this, weanalyse a sub-sectoral panel with data on almost all EU member states from 1995to 2015. We do not find evidence of within-EU pollution haven effects and find that trade integration has not overall led to an increase in new members' emission intensities, but it has led to a slight increase among old members. However, upon integrating further, the new members capital-intense sectors did increase their emissions compared to less capital-intense ones. We also nd that the accession and its announcement have reduced the emission intensity for air pollutants in new member states. This outcome is further supported by productivity increases that were spurred by the accession and led to decreases in CO2 intensities.

                            We study the effects of the EU ETS on competitiveness and investment decisions of Dutch manufacturing firms. We pay close attention to treatment effect heterogeneity by studying the heterogeneous effects for firms starting in different ETS phases. We use microdata from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) to apply two difference-in-differences (DiD) estimators. We employ both a two-way fixed effects regression, as well as a newer and more flexible DiD method that allows for multiple treatment periods, aligning with the phases of the EU ETS. We find no reduction in competitiveness in regulated firms, but in fact observe that companies that start in phase 1 both become larger and invest more. While the positive effect on competitiveness peaks in the mid 2010s, the effect on investments increases over time. For firms starting in later phases, we do not find any statistically significant effect of ETS participation.

                            This study brings the debate of trade and environment into the sphere of the circular economy. Motivated by several empirical facts on the close connection between trade, material usage, and CO2 emissions, it estimates the effect on trade openness both on domestic consumption of raw materials and on countries’ material footprint and compares these results with the effect for CO2. The study finds some support for the so called “Pollution Haven Hypothesis” in both domains. These effects are only visible for domestic measures of the environmental indicators, which is as expected, given that the results also indicate that rich countries outsource the dirty part of their production but do not reduce their dirty consumption. These effects are small in magnitude, but this could increase when countries tighten their regulation.  The trade effects are, however, dominated by the comparative advantage of capital-intense economies, which increases both countries’ domestic consumption and their emissions, as well as their footprint of raw materials and CO2 when opening up for trade.  Since capital-rich economies are usually more developed, this implies that, overall, developed countries increase their usage of materials and emissions more when opening up for trade than do poor countries. Finally, for both domestic consumption of materials material footprint intensity, the increase in the scale of production, which goes together with trade-led income changes, is the main driver of greater material usage and emissions of CO2. Overall, our findings send a signal to policy makers to take trade channels into consideration when designing stricter environmental regulation. The close resemblance of the results for raw materials and those for CO2 also shows that well-designed policy that covers both fields could increase the desired outcomes in both fields.

                    <!-- <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates how permanent and transitory credit shocks affect households' consumption smoothing patterns. Using a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model I simulate two different shock specifications as observed in credit panel data; one transitory and one permanent credit shock. I show that consumption insurance drops sharply on impact for both kind of shocks. The permanent shock induces a lower level of consumption insurance in the long run. Moreover, I show that these effects differ by current wealth holdings, with households at the lower end of the wealth distribution experiencing the largest drop. Consumption insurance measures in the data, computed with the new PSID consumption series, suggest that the credit shock induced by the grand financial crisis was transitory in nature. Consumption insurance reaches its trough in 2010, but bounces back to its pre-crisis value by 2016.</p> -->
