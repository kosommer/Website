                            We study the effects of market integration on manufacturing emission intensities of CO2 , SOx , and NOx . For this, we analyse the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements in a sub-sectoral panel with data on almost all EU member states from 1995 to 2015. We pay close attention to relevant channels of trade, regulation, and efficiency. Overall, the enlargements have resulted in a reduction of emission intensities in new member states: new regulations, which accession countries needed to adopt, have lowered pollution intensities strongly; induced improvements in productivity have further reduced them; and trade integration into the EU has had insignificant effects on emission intensities. We also do not find evidence of within-EU pollution haven effects and thus of leakage from old to new member states. For old members, trade integration, if anything, increased emission intensities, but efficiency improvements have also contributed to cleaner manufacturing sectors here.

                            We study the effects of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) on
                            competitiveness and investment decisions of Dutch manufacturing firms.
                            Motivated both by sizable differences between firms that are regulated in
                            different phases and by increasing regulatory stringency in the last years, we
                            pay close attention to treatment effect heterogeneity between firms and over
                            time. We use microdata from Statistics Netherlands to apply two difference-
                            in-differences (DiD) estimators, (1) a two-way fixed effects regression and
                            (2) a recently developed more flexible DiD method, designed for staggered
                            treatment timing and treatment effect heterogeneity. We find that firms
                            already regulated in phase 1 reduce their employment and increase their
                            investments at the end of phase 3, at which allowance prices started to rise
                            and treatment became more stringent. These findings are consistent with
                            the ideas of carbon leakage and the Porter hypothesis. For later regulated
                            firms, we do not find significant treatment effects, potentially explained by
                            their lower energy intensity and consequently lower regulatory burden

                           This paper estimates the effect of trade openness both on the domestic consumption of raw
                            materials and on countries’ material footprint, which measures the global material extraction
                            needed to feed a country’s domestic final demand. It compares these results with the trade effect
                            on CO2 emissions. The study finds some support for the so called “Pollution Haven Hypothesis”
                            in materials, driven by relocation of materials with industrial usage away from higher income
                            countries. These effects are only visible for domestic production measures of the environmental
                            indicators, and not for countries’ footprint measures. Higher income countries outsource the
                            material-intense part of their production but do not reduce their actual consumption of raw
                            materials. These effects are small in magnitude but statistically significant, indicating that the
                            effect could increase if the regulatory wedge between countries increases. The trade-induced
                            income effects are, however, dominated by a comparative advantage effect, according to which
                            production tend to locate where it is most efficient. As a result, capital-intense economies
                            experience the highest increases in domestic consumption of materials and emissions as well as
                            in their global footprint of raw materials and CO2 after a trade liberalization episode. Since
                            capital-rich economies usually post higher per-capita income, our results also suggest that higher
                            income countries increase their total usage of materials and emissions more when opening up
                            for trade than do lower income countries.

Using a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model I simulate two different shock specifications as observed in credit panel data; one transitory and one permanent credit shock. I show that consumption insurance drops sharply on impact for both kind of shocks. The permanent shock induces a lower level of consumption insurance in the long run. Moreover, I show that these effects differ by current wealth holdings, with households at the lower end of the wealth distribution experiencing the largest drop. Consumption insurance measures in the data, computed with the new PSID consumption series, suggest that the credit shock induced by the grand financial crisis was transitory in nature. Consumption insurance reaches its trough in 2010, but bounces back to its pre-crisis value by 2016.</p> -->
