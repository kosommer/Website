                            We study the effects of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) on economic performance and investments of Dutch manufacturing firms.
                            Motivated both by sizable differences between firms that are regulated in different phases and by a gradual increase in regulatory stringency,
                            we pay close attention to treatment effect heterogeneity between firms and over time. We use microdata from Statistics Netherlands to show
                            how using a two way fixed effect estimator in such a staggered difference-in-differences setting could lead biased results and
                            then use more recent econometric techniques to capture the ETS's treatment effect. We find no effects of the ETS on investment behavior
                            and profitability, 
                            but sizable negative effects on the turnover of firms that were regulated the earliest and were the most energy-intense.

                           This paper analyzes the effects of carbon taxation and carbon border adjustments in a setting
                    where firms can choose to respond to taxation by abating, or by outsourcing part of their production.
                    For this, we set up a general equilibrium trade model, calibrated with world trade and input-output 
                    data that features a discrete choice production structure, where the producers choose between 
                    outsourcing or abating emission-intensive intermediate production steps. The paper finds that
                    border adjustments that only target scope 1 emissions can lead to outsourcing, and thus leakage, 
                    further down the value chain, but nevertheless induce higher abatement both in the countries that
                    impose the border adjustment and in the ones affected by it.

                           We study the effects of market integration on manufacturing emission intensities of CO2, SOx, and NOx.
                            For this, we analyse the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements in a sectoral panel with data on almost all EU member states from 1995 to 2015.
                            We pay close attention to relevant channels of trade, regulation, and efficiency.
                            Overall, the enlargements have resulted in a reduction of emission intensities in new member states: new regulations,
                            which accession countries needed to adopt, have lowered pollution intensities strongly; induced improvements in productivity have further reduced them;
                            and trade integration into the EU has had insignificant effects on emission intensities. 
                            We also do not find evidence of within-EU pollution haven effects and thus of leakage from old to new member states. 
                            For old members, trade integration, if anything, increased emission intensities, 
                            but efficiency improvements have also contributed to cleaner manufacturing sectors here.

                           Free trade can drive efficiency increases in the utilization of natural
                           resources, but it can also leave countries overly exposed to foreign
                           sources of raw materials. Furthermore it can induce material intensive
                           production to relocate abroad if more stringent rules are adopted at
                           home, a phenomenon known as "leakage" in the trade and environment
                           literature.  Applying well-established concepts and analyses from
                           the trade and pollution literature to the effects of free trade on
                           natural resources and materials, we find statistically significant,
                           but economically small evidence, for higher income countries decreasing
                           their material usage when opening up for trade, while lower income 
                           countries increase theirs. This indicates some for of outsourcing.
                           We also find that the famous environmental Kuznets curve behavior seems 
                           to be present for materials as well, but the evidence on this is weaker
                           than for CO2. Finally, the similarities between the
                           results for raw materials and those for CO2 indicate that well-designed
                           policy that addresses both domains and takes trade channels into consideration could increase the desired outcomes.

Using a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model I simulate two different shock specifications as observed in credit panel data; one transitory and one permanent credit shock. I show that consumption insurance drops sharply on impact for both kind of shocks. The permanent shock induces a lower level of consumption insurance in the long run. Moreover, I show that these effects differ by current wealth holdings, with households at the lower end of the wealth distribution experiencing the largest drop. Consumption insurance measures in the data, computed with the new PSID consumption series, suggest that the credit shock induced by the grand financial crisis was transitory in nature. Consumption insurance reaches its trough in 2010, but bounces back to its pre-crisis value by 2016.</p> -->

                           This paper studies the effects of a 2017 ban on waste imports, imposed by China, on the reallocation of waste trade.
                    Until then, China imported between 30 and 50\% of all global waste, hence implying large diversion effects after the ban was implemented.
                    I plan to derive a theoretical model, showing that waste trade in essence occurs for two reasons: disposal and recycling. 
                    This implies that there is both an incentive for countries with higher environmental preferences to send waste intended for disposal abroad 
                    (a so-called "waste haven effect"), and for industry-intense economies to purchase waste, recycle it, and use it as an input in production. 
		            I then estimate the effect of the ban on the imports of all countries except China and plan to show how countries with different characteristics - 
                    regarding the two motives for waste trade - have responded differently to the shock. 
                    A very early analysis suggests that middle income countries and countries with low recycling costs have increased waste imports as a response.
